Find the coordinates of each point on the curve \\[x^{2} - 2xy + 2y^{2} = 4\\] at which the tangent is parallel to the x-axis.;;b) A curve is defined by the parametric equations \\[x = t^{2}, y = t^{3}\\]. Show that the equation of the tangent to the curve at the point \\[P(p^{2}, p^{3})\\] is \\[2y - 3px + p^{3} = 0\\]. Show that there is just one point on the curve at which the tangent passes through the point (-3, -5), and determine the coordinates of this point.",
